## Chapter 3　The Deal
  I was sleeping in an unknown room when I woke up. My senses feel a person nearby. My eye catched them as my sight came back.

  It was Motobe. “Good morning.” I ask him, “Where is this place?!”, and he answers.

  “Inside the company, of course. Get ready for some talking.” As I wake up, I open the door behind me and step through. But the hallway beyond the door was something I’ve never seen. Is this really the company?

  “Motobe, what is this company for?”

  He just laughs, and says,

  “Do you think I’ll tell you that easily? What are you doing in the first place, stealing the company’s money?”

  This conversation will last forever. Well, I did steal the money… But, in that case, I’ll flee the company, no matter what.

  “…Then, let’s have a deal. If you can satisfy me in five minutes, I’ll help you flee the company. Tell me everything you know about the company.”

  “……OK.”

  As I say that, I steal the New Nambu M60 from Motobe’s holster, and aim at him.

  “Satisfied? If you can satisfy me in five minutes, I might let you live. Tell me everything about the company.”

After some silence, I asked him.
  “Who are you?“

  “I, am Motobe, former manager of the External Escapee Management Department.”

  The silence continued after he answered the question.

  After a while, 

  “Did you know that the pistol is actually a lighter?”

  I immediately pulled the trigger to confirm, only to hear the gunshot.

  “And, that’s fake. There was only one live bullet loaded in that gun, and you used it. That means, that there aren't any live ones n…”

  Then, he stopped moving, just sitting down on the sofa. There wasn’t any second bullet. Red liquid came out from his left chest. And inside, was a 9mm live ammo.
