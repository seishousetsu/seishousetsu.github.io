## Chapter 1  The Beginning
 Since I was young, I have longed for the cities.

I was born and raised in the countryside. In that town, there was no video arcade nor shopping mall. And because of this, I admired cities such as Kyoto or Osaka. In that long list, I especially had one city, the city I wanted to go to for so long.

Tokyo.

Since the rise of the Edo Shogunate, the city that has kept growing, the city that surpassed even the former capital Kyoto. Tokyo. A place where buildings are tightly packed, and thousands of people are walking to work. A place we can hardly imagine here. I have seen it in textbooks several times, and heard some rumors about it, but I have never been there. I wanted to go, and see the city with my own eyes…

I tried to go to the city several times until now. But, the train stopping because of the bad weather, or because of electricity problems, I couldn’t go. I didn’t have enough money to travel anymore, and thus, my dreams were at risk of disappearing.

I thought that I needed more money to continue to try. So, I decided to search for work in this town.

I looked at the job magazines for a while, and found a fine job. Sakuma Construction. Seems like it’s job is mainly cleaning the bike roads. After quickly applying for the job, I got the position soon. It seems hard work, but the salary is high, so I decided to stay. And the next day, the first time, I went to the company.
