## Chapter 2　The Chase

  The first job was, just not bad. I even got a mate. But, the salary was a few times less than I heard, and even the correspondences were ambiguous. The company I went to was the so-called “Black company”.

  After working for a while, I, who couldn’t stand working with such low salary, stole some money from the company’s cash register, and fled. But the workers there wake up early, so they would notice the flea easily. I must leave for Tokyo by then.

  First, I went to the nearest station, buying the ticket to Tsukuba Station, where there is a train bound to Tokyo. Stopping by at a store, buying some food and drinks, I hopped on the train. Things went well until Tsukuba Station, but when I was buying the ticket for the train bound to Tokyo, I was called from behind.

  I looked back, and confirmed that the person who called me was the station staff. Feeling relieved, I answered, “What’s the matter?”

  “Well, I heard that there is a person who stole a company’s money nearby, and their face in this photo is similar to yours, so I just wanted to have a talk with y..”

  I was starting to run before I finished listening to them. The company is already aware of this. Why..? As I ran, I realized the truth. 

  The story goes back to just after joining the company…

  “So you’re Y̴̨͙͙͔͐̓͘ǎ̵̙̖̳͘ẃ̴̫̼̺́a̴̖̩͒͠t̸̯͓̙͈̚a̸͉͎͚̅̎̓r̴̜̙̉͐í̵̧̡̻, the new member. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me!”

  Since then, I became mates with Motobe. When I told him that the work is too hard, he always cheered me up. I thought he was a good person. Until now, that is.

  One night, just before bedtime,  I told him, “I think I’m going to flee this company..” Then, Motobe asked me if work is way too hard. He said that if I say yes, he will help me. I asked him to keep my inexistence as a secret. He agreed with it. To be honest, I was satisfied with it.

  But it seems that Motobe isn’t on my side. If I thought more deeply that there are no bad rumors in this company..

  Now, I am running through the station, heading towards the train to Tokyo. If I take that rapid train, I’ll arrive at Tokyo easily. Shortly after, my plan was deleted inside my head.

  Two company guards were waiting for me in front of the train. This is my fault, as I spoke all my plans to Motobe. But still, only two people might not stop me. I ran as soon as the train doors were opened.

  Before I could say goodbye to this town, I almost tripped. One of the company guards was grabbing my leg. I try to make the guard let go of my leg, but the guard still grabs tight on me. Eventually, more company came at me, and at last, I was taken down by them.

  Using my last power, I ask the passengers for help. But they ignore me ruthlessly. I get hit by one of the men, but I still ask someone for help.

  And blacking out, my consciousness falls into the dark.
